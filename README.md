The EORNA website is designed to store and visualize gene and transcript abundance data on demand as transcripts per million (TPM) across all samples and all the genes within the barley genome.

EORNA provides access to the gene and transcript abundances quantified using data from 22 RNA-seq experiments, covering 843 separate samples, as well as the sequence data and annotation for the Barley Reference Transcript Dataset.
